	- Knapsack Problem

7/2/16 (Sunday)
- [DONE] Link to specific algorithms on the side nav bar
- [DONE] Delete some of the unused controllers and views

- Created both Azure and local database
- Using database first method!
- Added a LINQ class for the tables in the local database
- Inner joined two tables (Algorithms and ParadigmType) into a single LINQ query
	- Using the result, show it onto the View [DONE]
	SELECT ...
	FROM Algorithms
	JOIN ParadigmTypes on ParadigmTypeId = Id
	WHERE Algorithms.Id = 1


6/2/2016 (Saturday)
- Create a local database
- Need to do ViewModels

3/2/2016 (Wednesday)
- [UI] Finished most of the UI on the main page. Need to design custom logos for each buttons
- [UI] Added a side navigational bar on the other layout of the page. 
	- Need to make them dynamic [TODO]
- [UI] Need to design the other segments of the layout in the pages [TODO]

1/1/2016 (Monday)
- [DESIGN] Main page layout of the program
- [DESIGN] The layout for other bits of the program

12/11/2015 
Complete these diagrams before the weekends (before 14/11/2015)
- Requirements specification [done.]
- UML case diagram [done]
- UML Class diagram [in progress]
- Interface diagram ?
- Flowchart of the software [done. to add into report]

NOTE:
- Should I include the bit where the program can make its own dynamic programming? etc?

To complete during the weekends (14/11/2015 & 15/11/2015)
- Algorithms of the animations (Psuedo code)
- Design of the animations
- evaluation list
- Might need to test animation on platform ****
- writeup of the design
- UI Design of the software

What to include in the writeup? [finish by saturday 14/11/2015]
1 - Summary of proposal
	- brief statement of the background [done]
	- aims and objectives of the project [done]
	- necessary changes made from previous report [not sure to do this]
	- summary of research and analysis carried out so far 

2 - Design [finish latest by Sunday 15/11/2015]
	- description of anticipated components of the system and how are they organised

	design chapter structure
	- functional and non-functional requirements [done]
	- UML case diagram [done]
	- flowchart diagrams [done]
	- ui design diagrams [done]
	- UML class diagram [in progress - still need classes for individual algorithms]
	- sequence diagram [done]
	- animation algorithm designs [15/11/15]
	- animation psuedo code [15/11/15]
	- evaluation design [15/11/15]

3 - Review against plan [finish latest by Monday 16/11/2015]
	- plan produced as part of the specification
		- what has been completed
		- progress made up to this date
	- any necessary changes need to make
	- gantt chart
