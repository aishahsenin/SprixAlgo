Work plan

12/11/2015 
Complete these diagrams before the weekends (before 14/11/2015)
- Requirements specification [done.]
- UML case diagram [done]
- UML Class diagram [in progress]
- Interface diagram ?
- Flowchart of the software [done. to add into report]

NOTE:
- Should I include the bit where the program can make its own dynamic programming? etc?

To complete during the weekends (14/11/2015 & 15/11/2015)
- Algorithms of the animations (Psuedo code)
- Design of the animations
- evaluation list
- Might need to test animation on platform ****
- writeup of the design
- UI Design of the software

What to include in the writeup? [finish by saturday 14/11/2015]
1 - Summary of proposal
	- brief statement of the background [done]
	- aims and objectives of the project [done]
	- necessary changes made from previous report [not sure to do this]
	- summary of research and analysis carried out so far 

2 - Design [finish latest by Sunday 15/11/2015]

	design chapter structure
	- functional and non-functional requirements [done]
	- UML case diagram [done]
	- flowchart diagrams [done]
	- ui design diagrams [done]
	- UML class diagram [in progress - still need classes for individual algorithms]
	- sequence diagram [done]
	- animation algorithm designs [15/11/15]
