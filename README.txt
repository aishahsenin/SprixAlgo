Work plan

12/11/2015 
Complete these diagrams before the weekends (before 14/11/2015)
- Requirements specification [done.]
- UML case diagram [done]
- UML Class diagram [in progress]
- Interface diagram ?
- Flowchart of the software [done. to add into report]

NOTE:
- Should I include the bit where the program can make its own dynamic programming? etc?

To complete during the weekends (14/11/2015 & 15/11/2015)
- Algorithms of the animations (Psuedo code)
- Design of the animations
- evaluation list
- Might need to test animation on platform ****
- writeup of the design
- UI Design of the software

What to include in the writeup?
1 - Summary of proposal
	- brief statement of the background
	- aims and objectives of the project
	- necessary changes made from previous report
	- summary of research and analysis carried out so far

2 - Design
	- description of anticipated  components of the system and how are they organised
	- algorithms psuedo code
	- design of the intended interfaces
	- description of the evaluation

3 - Review against plan
	- plan produced as part of the specification
		- what has been completed
		- progress made up to this date
	- any necessary changes need to make
	- gantt chart
