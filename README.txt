Complete these diagrams before the weekends (before 14/11/2015)
- Requirements specification [done.]
- UML case diagram [done]
- UML Class diagram [in progress]
- Interface diagram ?
- Flowchart of the software [done. to add into report]

NOTE:
- Should I include the bit where the program can make its own dynamic programming? etc?

To complete during the weekends (14/11/2015 & 15/11/2015)
- Algorithms of the animations (Psuedo code)
