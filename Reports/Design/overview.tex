\chapter{Overview}

\section{Project background}
This project primarily focuses on the animation of different types of commonly used algorithms, for the benefit of users to further understand how algorithms work in general. The scope of this project is within the animation of the main algorithmic paradigms, divide and conquer, greedy method, and dynamic programming. 

The aim for this project is to allow students to achieve greater understanding in algorithmic paradigms, by providing an animated explanation in a step by step basis. This is to convey the granulated structure of the algorithms, which allows them to speculate the steps by breaking the complicated algorithm down into smaller parts.
